The GET_NEXT_LINE function allows you to read content line by line from a file descriptor. 
This project introduces the concept of static variables in C programming and deepens understanding of file manipulation, memory allocation, and optimal buffer management.

This implementation can:

-Read from multiple file descriptors simultaneously without losing track of reading position

-Handle different line endings

-Work efficiently with both small and large files

-Process any valid file descriptor (files, standard input, even network connections)
